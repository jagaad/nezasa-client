    # Introduction

    The Nezasa Itinerary API provides RESTful services for creating Nezasa itineraries based on templates.
    JSON is returned by all API responses including errors.

    The JSON model used by the Nezasa Itinerary API follows the convention specified by JSON API 1.0
    (see https://jsonapi.org/).

    ## Doc Version

    Last Updated: 2025-01-06

    ## Compression

    All endpoints in the REST API support gzip compression for both request and response payloads. Most client side
    frameworks have built-in support for gzip encoding as well. Compressing API payloads improves an application's
    performance and reduces bandwidth consumption by sending and receiving smaller payloads.

    ## Content Type

    The Nezasa Itinerary API sends all JSON API data in response documents with the header
    `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` without any media type parameters. This media type must also be set
    in the `Accept` header.

    ## Localization

    Specifying localization parameters can be done via HTTP headers. Headers typically work quite nicely as URIs are
    unaffected, supported by all HTTP methods and don't affect GET caching. Language codes can be set with the HTTP
    header "Accept-Language" and support language negotiation. The protocol for language negotiation is similar to
    media type negotiation. The client expresses its intent by supplying an Accept-Language header with acceptable
    languages and their q header parameter values, and the server decides which one to use for the response.

    Example:

    ```
    GET /itineraries/v1.0/basdgsdgs HTTP/1.1
    Host: nicetours-ibe.tripbuilder.app
    Accept-Language: en,en-US,fr;q=0.6
    ```

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    ```

    The codes submitted are the 2-letter language codes in lower-case letters or the 5-letter codes consisting of a
    language code and the region code (e.g., en-US, en-CA, de-CH).

    ### Content Language Response

    The API will attempt to return content in the specified language when available. In cases where content or an item
    of content is not available in the requested language, it will fallback to EN. This means that the caller may receive
    a mix of languages - content in the language requested when available and English for the rest.

    This is also the reason why the `Content-Language` header is not set because the content may include multiple languages.

    ## Timeouts

    The Itinerary API has a general request timeout of 30 seconds. If a request cannot be served within this time a
    HTTP error 503 is returned and the connection is closed by the server.

    ## Error Handling

    Nezasa uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general,
    codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the
    information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted or is in the wrong format), and codes in the 5xx
    range indicate an error with Nezasa's servers.

    ## Host

    The host api.tripbuilder.app is used as placeholder in this documentation. The actual host to be used may be
    a white-labelled domain of your TripBuilder setup.

    # Authentication

    The Itinerary API doesn't enforce authentication. If itinerary creation is required in a public facing scenario then
    use the endpoint https://<white-label-ID>-ibe.tripbuilder.app without any authentication.

    In case the API is used in a scenario with the Nezasa Booking API (e.g, for CRS integrations) the same endpoint as
    for the Booking API can be used (https://api.tripbuilder.app). In this scenario the same credentials have to be provided
    via HTTP BasicAuth. See the Nezasa Booking API for details.

    All API requests must be made over HTTPS.

        __Example: Instantiate New Itinerary incl. International Flight__

        If a new itinerary including the international flight shall be created this can be controlled with the
        attribute `instantiateWith` in the request body. International flights can be created under the following
        conditions:

        - Your TripBuilder instance has to be configured with a GDS integration to search and book flights
        - The number of adult PAX needs to be specified in the request
        - The departure airport needs to be defined using a 3-letter IATA airport code
        - The GDS integration needs to deliver results within 25 seconds

        From the flight search result the best flight is picked using the following strategy:
        - At maximum 3 flight legs per outbound or inbound flight
        - The flight with the cheapest fare is chosen

        ```

        The response contains the unique identifier of the itinerary and thus can be used to redirect the user
        to the planner with that itinerary opened. Usually it is a good idea to redirect users to the route
        editor which allows them to customize the route.

    post:
      summary: Generates auto-auth magic links for agency accesses
      description: |
        This secured API endpoint can only be called by a tour operator user to create a magic link for
        an agency. The returned magic link will contain the URL to be accessed together with an authentication
        token to automatically log in the agency. The token is valid for one hour.

        This endpoint triggers the generation of a magic link for authentication purposes.

        **Sample Sequence of Use Case Events:**

        1. **Agent User** initiates an action (e.g., button click) in the External Application (e.g., CRS).
        2. **External App** sends a request to the **Itinerary API** to obtain a magic link for the TripBuilder URL. 
             This needs to be an authenticated call, using the technical API user of the tour operator.
        3. **Itinerary API** returns the magic link along with an authentication token back to the **External App**.
        4. **External App** redirects the user to the magic link.
        5. **TripBuilder** authenticates the agency automatically thanks to the token which is part of the magic link.
        6. **TripBuilder** displays the interface to the user as per TripBuilder URL for which the magic link was created.

        Remarks:

        - **URL Parameters:** Include the URL parameters required by the target URL in the input target URL.
        - **Input validation:** The endpoint performs security validations if the tour operator user is allowed 
            to generate the magic link. The endpoint doesn't validate in any form the target URL (hint: will be 
            performed by the target URL's implementation).
        - **Tour Operator, Distribution Channel**: the domain of the magic link API endpoint and the target URL
            need to match because of security reasons. The determines the tour operator and the distribution channel
            from it.

        the location ID takes precedence. Searching by the descriptive fields is best effort and might not always
        be successful. If it fails, the itinerary creation will fail overall.

        Whenever possible, it is recommended to use the location ID.

        Area search: whenever possible, pass the country code as well to narrow down the search. The search
        will leverage the area ratings and pick the highest ranked area within the search results. There
        is no error/warning if the search results return several areas.

        Airport search: always use the ID-based approach for airports. The airport definition by name is not
        supported because generally, the IATA code of an airport is publicly known and can be used.

            If GiataId, the system looks for the accommodation with the given Giata ID and uses the location
            of the accommodation to search for the area.

            If Atcore is used, the system looks for the accommodation with the given Atcore ID and uses the location
            of the accommodation to search for the area.

          - `departureLocationRef` must also be defined in the request in this case.

        - name: this way, a search with a fuzzy match is performed to find
          the best matching hotels. It's possible that another hotel is taken
          that has a similar name. The location is derived from the stop location.
        - accommodationRating: this allows to define a general preference
          of hotel quality w/o picking a specific hotel. The system then tries
          to automatically pick a hotel of the given service level.
        - accommodationProperties: this allows to fully define an accommodation.
          The system will create the accommodation with the given properties.
